This directory contains data files for all the spectrophotometric standard
stars presented in the two papers by Hamuy et al. The first paper is devoted
to wavelengths from 3300 to 7550A (Hamuy et al., PASP, 104, 533, 1992);
the second to wavelengths from 6000 to 10500A (Hamuy et al., PASP,
106, 566, 1994). The second paper consolidates both sets of observations
and presents AB magnitudes for the 10 secondary standards at 16A intervals
from 3300 to about 10400A and for the 19 tertiary standards at 50A intervals
from 3300 to about 10300A.

The 'f' files list wavelength ( A ), flux ( ergs/cm/cm/s/A * 10**16 )
and flux ( milli-Jy ) and bin (A). The file name consists of a prefix
'f' and the star name.

The 'm' files list wavelength ( A ), AB magnitude and bin (A). The file
name consists of a prefix 'm' and the star name.
