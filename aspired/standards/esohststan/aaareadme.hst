This directory contains data files for a variety of spectrophotometric
standard stars taken from the CALSPEC and CALOBS collection at STScI. 
(see 
http://www.stsci.edu/hst/observatory/cdbs/astronomical_catalogs.html )

NOTE that the following data files have optical fluxes derived from 
models and should be used with caution for flux calibration of 
observational spectra in the optical wavelength range:
fhr153.dat and mhr153.dat for star HR153
fbpm16274.dat and mbpm16274.dat for star BPM 16274
fhr1996.dat and mhr1996.dat for star HR1996
fhd49798.dat and mhd49798.dat for star HD 49798 
fhd60753.dat and mhd60753.dat for star HD 60753
fhr4554.dat and mhr4554.dat for star HR4554
fhr5191.dat and mhr5191.dat for star HR5191

The 'f' files list wavelength ( A ), flux ( ergs/cm/cm/s/A * 10**16 )
and flux ( milli-Jy ) and bin (A). The file name consists of a prefix
'f' and the star name. 

The 'm' files list wavelength ( A ), AB magnitude and bin (A). The file 
name consists of a prefix 'm' and the star name.
